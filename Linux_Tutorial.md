# **A Beginner\'s Guide to the Linux Command Line**

This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial for understanding and using
the Linux command line, based on the foundational concepts of the
UNIX/Linux operating system.

## **Lesson 1: Introduction and Background**

This first part sets the stage, explaining what the guide is about and
giving you some historical context.

### **Introduction & Lab Objectives**

-   **Purpose**: The guide is designed to give you the basic knowledge
    > needed to work with Linux systems. It covers everything from
    > simple navigation to more advanced command-line skills.

-   **Goals**: By the end, you should be able to:

    -   Use the command-line interface (the \"terminal\") effectively.

    -   Understand how Linux organizes files, who can access them
        > (permissions), and how it runs programs (processes).

    -   Learn how to redirect input/output and the basics of scripting.

    -   Become efficient at using the terminal.

### **UNIX and Linux Background**

-   **UNIX**: Created in 1969 at Bell Labs, UNIX was designed as a
    > multiuser, multitasking operating system. Think of \"UNIX\" not as
    > one single OS, but as a standard or a blueprint. Many operating
    > systems are \"UNIX-based,\" including Linux and macOS.

-   **Linux**: Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, his goal was to make a
    > free, open-source version of a UNIX-like OS that could run on
    > personal computers. It\'s developed collaboratively and comes in
    > different versions called **distributions** (or \"distros\"), like
    > Ubuntu, Fedora, and Red Hat.

### **Key UNIX/Linux Principles**

1.  **Everything is a file**: In Linux, almost everything is represented
    > as a file, including hardware devices, directories, and even
    > running programs.

2.  **Small tools philosophy**: Each program is designed to do one
    > specific thing and do it very well.

3.  **Pipe and filter**: You can connect these small, simple tools
    > together to perform complex tasks.

4.  **Hierarchical file system**: All files and directories are
    > organized in a single tree-like structure that starts from the
    > \"root,\" which is represented by a single slash (/).

## **Lesson 2: User Interface and the Terminal**

This section explains the two ways you can use Linux: with a graphical
interface or with a powerful text-based interface.

### **User Interface Methods**

1.  **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: This is a text-based environment
    > where you type commands into a program called a **Terminal** or
    > **Shell**. It\'s powerful, precise, and preferred by system
    > administrators for automation and remote access. You can typically
    > open it with Ctrl + Alt + T.

2.  **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: This is the familiar desktop
    > environment with icons, windows, and menus that most users are
    > accustomed to.

### **The Terminal and Shell**

-   **Understanding the Prompt**: The prompt, username@hostname:\~\$,
    > tells you who you are (username), what machine you\'re on
    > (hostname), where you are (\~ is your home directory), and your
    > privilege level (\$ for a regular user, \# for the root/admin
    > user).

-   **Shell Types**: The \"shell\" is the program that interprets your
    > commands. **bash (Bourne Again Shell)** is the most common and
    > feature-rich shell used in Linux today.

-   **Manual Pages (man)**: The man command is the single most essential
    > tool for learning. It shows you the manual for other commands. For
    > example, man ls shows the manual for the ls command.

## **Lesson 3: The Linux File System**

This section explains the folder structure of Linux and how to navigate
it.

### **Important Directories**

-   /: The **root directory**. The starting point for the entire file
    > system.

-   /bin: Contains essential system commands.

-   /etc: Holds all system-wide configuration files.

-   /home: Contains a personal home directory for each user.

-   /var: Used for variable data, such as system logs.

-   /dev: Contains \"device files\" that represent hardware.

### **Path Types**

A \"path\" is the address of a file or directory.

1.  **Absolute Paths**: Start from the root directory (/). Example:
    > /home/username/Documents.

2.  **Relative Paths**: Are based on your current location. Example:
    > Documents/file.txt.

### **Special Path Symbols**

-   . (a single dot) refers to the **current directory**.

-   .. (two dots) refers to the **parent directory** (one level up).

-   \~ (a tilde) refers to your **home directory**.

## **Lesson 4: File Permissions**

Permissions control who can read, write to, or execute files and
directories.

### **Permission Structure**

The permission string (e.g., -rwxr-xr\--) is broken into four parts:

1.  **File Type**: - for a file, d for a directory.

2.  **User (Owner) Permissions**: The first set of rwx.

3.  **Group Permissions**: The second set of rwx.

4.  **Other Permissions**: The third set of rwx.

### **Permission Meanings**

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------
  Permission      On Files                On Directories
  --------------- ----------------------- -------------------------------
  **r (read)**    View the contents       List the contents

  **w (write)**   Modify the contents     Create or delete files inside

  **x (execute)** Run as a program        Enter the directory (cd)
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Numeric Permissions**

Permissions can be represented by numbers: r=4, w=2, x=1. These are
added together for each group (User, Group, Other).

-   **755** (rwxr-xr-x): Common for programs/directories.

-   **644** (rw-r\--r\--): Common for regular text files.

### **Assignment: Directory Permissions**

1.  **Setup**: In your home directory, create a main project directory
    > called secret_project. Inside it, create a subdirectory called
    > shared_with_team.

2.  **Apply Permissions**:

    -   Set permissions on secret_project so only you can access it
        > (700).

    -   Set permissions on shared_with_team so you have full control,
        > but your group members can only enter and list contents (750).

3.  **Verify**: Use ls -ld \<directory_name\> to check the permissions.

### **Solution: Directory Permissions**

Bash

\# Part 1: Setup

mkdir secret_project

mkdir secret_project/shared_with_team

\# Part 2: Apply Permissions

chmod 700 secret_project

chmod 750 secret_project/shared_with_team

\# Part 3: Verify

ls -ld secret_project

\# Expected output starts with drwx\-\-\-\-\--

ls -ld secret_project/shared_with_team

\# Expected output starts with drwxr-x\-\--

## **Lesson 5: Essential Commands**

These are the commands you\'ll use most often for managing files and
viewing content.

### **File and Directory Operations**

-   ls: Lists the contents of a directory.

-   cd: Changes your current directory.

-   pwd: Shows your current location.

-   mkdir: Creates a new directory.

-   touch: Creates a new, empty file.

-   cp: Copies files or directories.

-   mv: Moves or renames files and directories.

-   rm: Deletes files.

### **Safe File Viewing**

-   cat: Displays the entire content of short files.

-   less: A powerful pager for viewing long files (scroll up/down,
    > search).

-   head: Shows the first few lines of a file.

-   tail: Shows the last few lines (great for logs).

### **Text Processing**

-   grep: Searches for text patterns within files.

-   sed: A \"stream editor\" for finding and replacing text.

-   awk: A tool for processing patterns and extracting columns.

### **Assignment: Practice with Essential Commands**

1.  **Management**: Create a directory practice, and inside it, a
    > directory notes. Create file1.txt in practice and file2.txt in
    > notes. Move file2.txt into practice, then delete the empty notes
    > directory.

2.  **Viewing/Searching**: Create a file log.txt with several lines of
    > text, including one line with the word \"ERROR\". Use cat to see
    > the whole file, head and tail to see the start and end, and grep
    > to find the \"ERROR\" line.

3.  **Permissions**: Create a file script.sh. Use ls -l to see its
    > permissions. Use chmod 755 script.sh to make it executable and
    > verify with ls -l again.

### **Solution: Practice with Essential Commands**

Bash

\# Part 1: Management

mkdir practice

cd practice

mkdir notes

touch file1.txt

touch notes/file2.txt

mv notes/file2.txt .

rmdir notes

cd ..

\# Part 2: Viewing/Searching

echo \"Line 1\" \> log.txt

echo \"Line 2 ERROR\" \>\> log.txt

echo \"Line 3\" \>\> log.txt

cat log.txt

head -1 log.txt

tail -1 log.txt

grep \"ERROR\" log.txt

\# Part 3: Permissions

touch script.sh

ls -l script.sh

chmod 755 script.sh

ls -l script.sh

## **Lesson 6: I/O Redirection and Pipes**

This section explains how to control the input and output of commands.

### **I/O Redirection**

-   command \> file.txt: Redirects output to file.txt, **overwriting**
    > the file.

-   command \>\> file.txt: Redirects output, **appending** to the end of
    > the file.

-   command 2\> errors.txt: Redirects only error messages.

-   command \> file.txt 2\>&1: Redirects both normal output and errors
    > to the same file.

### **Pipes (\|)**

A pipe connects the output of one command to the input of another,
letting you build powerful \"pipelines.\"

-   **Example**: history \| grep \"sudo\" finds all the sudo commands
    > you\'ve recently run.

### **Assignment: I/O Redirection and Pipes**

1.  **Redirection**: Save a listing of /etc to a file called
    > listing.txt. Append a listing of /usr to the same file.

2.  **Errors**: Run ls / /fake_dir. Save only the error to error.log.
    > Then, save both the success and error output to combined.log.

3.  **Pipes**: Build a pipeline to find the 3 most used commands in your
    > history (history \| awk \'{print \$2}\' \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort
    > -nr \| head -3).

### **Solution: I/O Redirection and Pipes**

Bash

\# Part 1

ls /etc \> listing.txt

ls /usr \>\> listing.txt

\# Part 2

ls / /fake_dir 2\> error.log

ls / /fake_dir \> combined.log 2\>&1

\# Part 3

history \| awk \'{print \$2}\' \| sort \| uniq -c \| sort -nr \| head -3

## **Lesson 7: Processes and Job Control**

This covers how to manage programs that are currently running.

### **Processes vs. Jobs**

-   **Process**: Any running program, each with a unique Process ID
    > (PID).

-   **Job**: A process managed by your command shell.

### **Job States and Control**

-   **command &**: Starts a command in the background.

-   **Ctrl+C**: Terminates the current foreground job.

-   **Ctrl+Z**: Suspends the current foreground job.

-   **jobs**: Lists all of your current background/suspended jobs.

-   **bg**: Resumes a suspended job in the background.

-   **fg**: Brings a background job to the foreground.

### **Process Management**

-   ps aux: Lists all running processes on the system.

-   top: Shows a real-time dashboard of processes.

-   kill PID: Politely terminates a process by its ID.

-   kill -9 PID: Force-kills a process.

-   pkill name: Kills a process by its name.

### **Assignment: Processes and Job Control**

1.  Start sleep 300 & in the background. Check it with jobs.

2.  Bring it to the foreground with fg. Suspend it with Ctrl+Z. Resume
    > it in the background with bg.

3.  Start ping 8.8.8.8 and suspend it. You should now have two jobs.

4.  Terminate the ping job with kill %\<job_number\>.

5.  Terminate the sleep job with pkill sleep.

### **Solution: Processes and Job Control**

Bash

\# Step 1

sleep 300 &

jobs

\# Step 2

fg

\# Press Ctrl+Z

bg

\# Step 3

ping 8.8.8.8

\# Press Ctrl+Z

\# Step 4 (assuming ping is job %2)

kill %2

\# Step 5

pkill sleep

## **Lesson 8: Shell Efficiency Features**

These features make using the shell faster and easier.

-   **Command History**: Use the **Up/Down arrows** to navigate history.
    > Press **Ctrl+R** to do a reverse search.

-   **Tab Completion**: Press **Tab** to auto-complete commands, files,
    > and paths. Press it twice to see all possibilities.

-   **Command Line Editing**: Use Ctrl+A (start of line), Ctrl+E (end of
    > line), Ctrl+U (delete to start), and Ctrl+K (delete to end).

-   **Aliases**: Create shortcuts for long commands with alias ll=\'ls
    > -la\'. Make them permanent by adding them to your \~/.bashrc file.

## **Lesson 9: Environment Variables**

These special variables control how your shell and other programs
behave.

### **Common Variables**

-   HOME: Your home directory.

-   PATH: Directories searched for commands.

-   USER: Your current username.

### **Working with Variables**

-   **View a variable**: echo \$HOME.

-   **Set a temporary variable**: MY_VAR=\"hello\"

-   **Make it an environment variable**: export MY_VAR

-   **Make it permanent**: Add the export line to your \~/.bashrc file.
    > Then run source \~/.bashrc to activate the changes in your current
    > session.

### **Assignment: Environment Variables**

1.  Display the values of your HOME and USER variables.

2.  Add a permanent alias c=\'clear\' to your \~/.bashrc file.

3.  Add a permanent environment variable export GREETING=\"Welcome back,
    > \$USER\" to your \~/.bashrc file.

4.  Activate the changes and test both the new alias (c) and variable
    > (echo \$GREETING).

### **Solution: Environment Variables**

Bash

\# Step 1

echo \$HOME

echo \$USER

\# Step 2

echo \"alias c=\'clear\'\" \>\> \~/.bashrc

\# Step 3

echo \'export GREETING=\"Welcome back, \$USER\"\' \>\> \~/.bashrc

\# Step 4

source \~/.bashrc

c

echo \$GREETING

## **Lesson 10: Best Practices and Conclusion**

Final tips and the core philosophy of Linux.

### **Best Practices**

-   **Security**: Use sudo, avoid logging in as root. Don\'t use 777
    > permissions.

-   **Efficiency**: Learn keyboard shortcuts, use tab completion, and
    > master pipes.

-   **File Management**: Use descriptive names, logical folders, and
    > regular backups.

### **Conclusion**

The key to mastering Linux is regular practice. Remember the UNIX
philosophy: combine small, simple tools to solve complex problems. This
guide provides the foundation for you to explore and become proficient
in this powerful environment.
